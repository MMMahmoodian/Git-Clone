# Building a Git Clone in Golang

This repository documents my journey of creating a minimal Git clone in Golang. I'm doing this project to deepen my understanding of Golang, version control systems, and software architecture. Each step is broken down into clear milestones, making it easier to follow and learn incrementally.

If you're looking to improve your own Golang skills or simply curious about how Git works under the hood, feel free to use this roadmap as a guide. I'll link each step to its corresponding Pull Request (PR), providing practical examples and making the learning process more transparent.
